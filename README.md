# epidemic_models

I create this with the purpose of practising my python coding skills and mathematical modelling skill.

This repository contains a number of particle-based epidemic models.

I wil be adding multple versions with different styles of coding and models, increasing in complexity and efficiency.

MODEL 1:
Partilce based
Using classes for individuals and population

MODEL 2: (work in progress)
Particle based
Using matrices
